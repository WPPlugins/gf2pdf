== Upgrade Notice ==
= 2.1.8 =
**WARNING** DO NOT Upgrade from 1.0.2 to 2.1.8 if you are using the plugin for PDF merges.  We complete rewrote the plugin and there is not a way to migrate old merges to the new plugin.  The new plugin is far more stable, and build with the intentions of future compatability, if you upgrade you will need to redo your mappings from your gravity forms to PDF documents.  All future upgrades will not require this as mappings are now saved in the database
